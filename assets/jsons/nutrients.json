    "description": "A group of unsaturated nutritional organic compounds that includes retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and several provitamin A carotenoids (most notably beta-carotene).[1][2] Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system, and for good vision.[3][4] Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin, the light-absorbing molecule[5] necessary for both low-light (scotopic vision) and color vision.[6] Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as retinoic acid (an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol), which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells.",
